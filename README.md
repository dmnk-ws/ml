# Machine Learning

A structured learning path through fundamental ML concepts, from linear algebra and Python basics to convolutional neural networks and deep dream.

## Structure

| Folder | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `1/` | Linear Algebra | Matrix operations implemented from scratch (multiplication, transpose) |
| `2/` | Python Basics | Collections, iteration, list comprehensions, recursion |
| `3/` | Classification | Softmax, ReLU, cross-entropy loss, linear classifier trained on MNIST |
| `4/` | Optimization | Gradient descent with convergence visualization |
| `6/` | NumPy | Array operations, broadcasting, indexing, image manipulation |
| `7/` | TensorFlow | Tensor operations, softmax and ReLU in TensorFlow |
| `8/` | Deep Learning | CNN with residual connections trained on SVHN |
